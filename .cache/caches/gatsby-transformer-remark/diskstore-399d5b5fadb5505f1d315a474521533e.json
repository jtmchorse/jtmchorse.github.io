This time we'll need to install a new plugin so Gatsby knows how to parse MD files. This plugin happens to be called <code>gatsby-transformer-remark</code>. </p>\n<p>Then we start building out the query in our GraphiQL page.</p>\n<p>&#x3C;img\nsrc={\"../../Screenshot from 2019-10-31 06-06-46.png\"}\nalt=\"gatsby config plugin details\"\n/>\nAgain like we learned yesterday, we need to access that data in the js file and display it.\n&#x3C;img\nsrc={\"../../Screenshot from 2019-10-31 06-07-57.png\"}\nalt=\"gatsby config plugin details\"\n/>\nThis time we've added a sort to the query pages with a more recent date will show up at the top, and then because we don't want our one MD page to get lonely we make anoter one.\nExample <Link to=\"new-index\">page</Link>\nAs best I can tell at this current time these MD pages have not actually been rendered into an actual page that we can navigate to. More research required here..\n</div>\n</p>"}

And then how I said things might have changed a litttle on gatsyb's site, and also that I was likely doing something wrong.</p>\n<p>It was me.</p>\n<p>When you install the gatsby source filesystem plugin, you get to tell it which path to look at.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/Screenshot%20from%202019-10-31%2005-16-38.png\" alt=\"gatsby config plugin details\"></p>\n<!-- <img\n  src={\"../../Screenshot from 2019-10-31 05-16-38.png\"}\n  alt=\"gatsby config plugin details\"\n/> -->\n<p>When I had installed mine prior to yestdays tutorial, I had told the path to look inside images. Hence the returns of my query were only ever images.\nThis is what we're seeing now.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/public/Screenshot%20from%202019-10-31%2005-19-30.png\" alt=\"gatsby config plugin details\"></p>\n<p>&#x3C;img\nsrc={\"../../Screenshot from 2019-10-31 05-19-30.png\"}\nalt=\"\"\n/></p>\n<p>Now that we have that out of the way, we get to start messing about\nwith markdown files.</p>\n<p>After we make our first markdown page, aka MD, we'll need to make a new .js page to run a new query. This time we'll need to install a new plugin so Gatsby knows how to parse MD files. This plugin happens to be called <code>gatsby-transformer-remark</code>. </p>\n<p>Then we start building out the query in our GraphiQL page.</p>\n<p>&#x3C;img\nsrc={\"../../Screenshot from 2019-10-31 06-06-46.png\"}\nalt=\"gatsby config plugin details\"\n/>\nAgain like we learned yesterday, we need to access that data in the js file and display it.\n&#x3C;img\nsrc={\"../../Screenshot from 2019-10-31 06-07-57.png\"}\nalt=\"gatsby config plugin details\"\n/>\nThis time we've added a sort to the query pages with a more recent date will show up at the top, and then because we don't want our one MD page to get lonely we make anoter one.\nExample <Link to=\"new-index\">page</Link>\nAs best I can tell at this current time these MD pages have not actually been rendered into an actual page that we can navigate to. More research required here..\n</div>\n</p>"}

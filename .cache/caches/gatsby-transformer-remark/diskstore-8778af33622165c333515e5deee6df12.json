A table of contents!</p>\n      <p>No we are starting to get an idea for some of those \"added performance benefits\"</p>\n      <p>ActiveStyle | ActiveClassName | getProps (isCurrent, isPartiallyCurent, href, etc etc)</p>\n      <p>Cool, so use the link tag for internal links, and if you are going to be running a CMS build <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-link/#reminder-use-link-only-for-internal-links\">this</a> little helper so you don't have to worrry. It'll render a link for internal and a href for external.</p>\n      <p>Man I hardly feel like we've scratched the surface with the layouts & api, and thats just Gatsby, we aren't event taking into consideration that Gatsby is really just React.</p>\n    </div>\n  ","position":{"start":{"line":2,"column":1,"offset":1},"end":{"line":26,"column":3,"offset":1952}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":26,"column":3,"offset":1952}}}}

Originally that was passed a string of \"page-2\" for our second markdown post, but now we've made it all super fancy with a string variable (that was declared right after query) and then we set the variable later. In this case we set it manually again, so not exactly reducing our workload, but hey its programming so we know we can get the var and do what we want later. Right?</p>"}

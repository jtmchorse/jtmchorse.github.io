The tool\n        automatically generates unique class and animation names, so you donâ€™t\n        have to worry about selector name collisions.\"\n      </p>\n      <p>But why is that useful?</p>\n      <p>\n        Lets take a look at our{\" \"}\n        <Link to=\"/about-css-modules/\">container componet</Link> that we created\n        in this section.\n      </p>\n      ![Screen shot of css component](../../Screenshot from 2019-10-22 05-44-17.png)\n<pre><code>  &#x3C;p>\n    Nothing super fancy, obviously.

According to the tutorial, by using the\n    css as a .module.css Gatsby will render components like this, all\n    bundled up as one little self contained thing. All so we don't have css\n    issues with other components. Thanks Obama.\n  &#x3C;/p>\n  &#x3C;p>\n    This is just a simple example of course, I'm assuming that in the future\n    you can hold components inside other components and so on. Feels like\n    building any sort of not basic site would require that.\n  &#x3C;/p>\n  &#x3C;p>Unexpected issues from today&#x3C;/p>\n  &#x3C;ul>\n    &#x3C;li>Inserting images&#x3C;/li>\n  &#x3C;/ul>\n&#x3C;/div>\n</code></pre>"}

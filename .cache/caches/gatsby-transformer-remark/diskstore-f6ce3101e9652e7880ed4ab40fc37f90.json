In our previous lesson we created some pagination, with some logic to not show Prev Page if we're on the first page. </p>\n<p>We started with creating a few more junk markdown posts so we'd have handful to work with. Then we moved into the <code>blog-template.js</code> file and added a bit more code. Blog template is where we have all our logic for displaying the blog posts, and also our pagination logic. Ideally we should move the pagination to its own js file, but for now this is just fine.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/for-each-loop.png\" alt=\"for each loop\"></p>\n<p>If you look at the above screenshot, on line 61, you'll see we have totalPages inside our context statement. This will be important.</p>\n<p>Back over in our blog-template.js file, we need to pass that to to our <em>pageContext</em> variable. You can see where we add that in the screen shot just blow, on line 8.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/page-context-blog-template-js.png\" alt=\"page context variable\"></p>\n<p>Bringing that over to this template page gives us the integer to work with, and remember from our for each screenshot we have postsPerPage set to 1.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/pagination-links-blog-template-js.png\" alt=\"pagination logic\"></p>"}

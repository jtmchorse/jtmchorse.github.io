I've been a fan of using the fake contact page as our testing ground, lets keep that up.</p>\n      <p>\n        <Link to=\"contact\">/contact</Link>\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Alright, now we have a new layout, and an even more ugly about page. I'm currently refusing to play with the typography plugins. Now its time to.. do some GraphQL.\n      </p>\n      <p>I love the seperation of content like this. As the tutorial points out, say we have a bunch of pages and we want the site title to be on them, we <i>could</i> type that into every page, but then finding and replacing that in the future is not only giant PITA it also is a bad way to work.</p>\n      <p>This is also why I'm much more of a fan of the css-modules vs the b.s. crap of styling directly in the js pages.. I'm looking at you tutorial <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-four/#create-a-new-example-site\">part-four layout.js</a></p>\n      <img src={`../../Screenshot from 2019-10-28 05-58-29.png`}\n        alt=\"css directly on markup\"\n      />\n      <p>So where are we with all this querying? My contact page now includes the \"hello world - gasby\" site title. Because, you know, I'm super creative.</p>\n      <p>One thing I would like to call special attention to is, that if you are like me and type every part of the examples out so that you pay extra close attention to the query const.</p>\n      <img \n      src=\"../../Screenshot from 2019-10-28 06-03-41.png\" \n      alt=\"query const in the about page\"\n      />\n      <p>There are bacticks, ` that you need to include. Gatsby doesn't like it if you don't have them there. In fact Gatsby doesn't like it so much that you won't be able to move forward until you put them in. Please remember to backtick responsibly.</p>\n      <p>See you on day 14.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n      <h2>Day 12 - Continued layout & the Link tag</h2>\n      <p>Add stuff inside the layout we just made.</p>\n      <p>Todays finishing up of part-three has us adding some navigation elements insid the layout2.js file</p>\n      <img\n        src={\"../../Screenshot from 2019-10-27 06-09-46.png\"}\n        alt=\"Additional elements inside the layout2.js file\"\n      />\n      <p>And now we have navigation links on our <Link to=\"/contact\">/contact</Link> page</p>\n      <img\n        src={\"../../Screenshot from 2019-10-27 06-24-10.png\"}\n        alt=\"Rendered nav from our updated layout component\"\n      />\n      <p>I've been wondering what the difference between the a tag and the link tag is. </p>\n      <p>Enter <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/linking-between-pages/\">\"The Gatsby link component\"</a></p>\n      <p>Essentially we are told that the link component is supposed to be used for internal gatsby linking, because \"but with added performance benefits\"..</p>\n      <p>But, what are those benefits?</p>\n      <p>In the Other resources section on the docs page we find a link to the <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-link/\">Gatsby API.</a></p>\n      <p>Alright, now we're getting somewhere. A table of contents!</p>\n      <p>No we are starting to get an idea for some of those \"added performance benefits\"</p>\n      <p>ActiveStyle | ActiveClassName | getProps (isCurrent, isPartiallyCurent, href, etc etc)</p>\n      <p>Cool, so use the link tag for internal links, and if you are going to be running a CMS build <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-link/#reminder-use-link-only-for-internal-links\">this</a> little helper so you don't have to worrry. It'll render a link for internal and a href for external.</p>\n      <p>Man I hardly feel like we've scratched the surface with the layouts & api, and thats just Gatsby, we aren't event taking into consideration that Gatsby is really just React.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n      <h2>Day 11 - Gatsbyjs tutorials part-three</h2>\n      <p>Holy typography plugins batman, look at that h1 right now.</p>\n      <img\n        src={\"../../Screenshot from 2019-10-25 05-39-26.png\"}\n        alt=\"H1 typographic styles from gatsby plugin\" />\n      <p>Interesting little side bar there, installing plugins. Learning how to add multiple plugins to the gatsby-config.js will be useful I imagine.</p>\n      <p>Moving on to making layouts. Its suggested to start with another new site, but I think I'll keep plugging away with the one I have for now.</p>\n      <p>Lets make some a new basic type page, /contact will do. And man is it basic. Pure text goodness.</p>\n      <p><a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-three/#-create-your-first-layout-component\">Gatsby then has us make a new layout</a>, only problem for me is I already have `layout` so I'll name this one layout2.js</p>\n      <img\n        src={\"../../Screenshot from 2019-10-25 06-04-08.png\"}\n        alt=\"Code used in layout2.js\"\n      />\n      <p>I'm sure that can guess what comes next.

Yes, yes you guessed it, import that. Here is the fun part for me, we can name it anything we want to when we call it in. Import Pacha?

If someone else had to jump in and was looking down through the code.. WTF why Pacha? Or in all reality you are likely to forget why you did what you did in all of 2 or 3 days, let alone coming back to a project months after you put it down. So, yeah. Lets be lame and call it by what it does. Layout2 it is..</p>\n      <p>So just what does Pacha, I mean.. Layout2 actually give us?</p>\n      <img\n        src={\"../../Screenshot from 2019-10-25 06-26-04.png\"}\n        alt=\"Basic contact page, minimal css\"\n      />\n      <p>Our layout component takes this basic page, and well wraps a layout around it.</p>\n      <img\n        src={\"../../Screenshot from 2019-10-25 06-26-21.png\"}\n        alt=\"Basic contact page, minimal css\"\n      />\n      <p>Now that we have a new layout, whenever we make a page we'll just call the layot2 component and all our pages will have the same base look.</p>\n      <p>If you have ever install the basic gatsby site, you'll see that layouts can house other components as well. Just look up at the nav here, and the footer. Both of those components are inside the layout componet. I bet we'll get to do that pretty soon in the tutorials.</p>\n    </div>\n\n    <div>\n      <h2>Day 10 - Finishing up zsh components and some nvm love</h2>\n      <p>For whatever reason every time I start up a bash, or more recently a zsh terminal I have to run `nvm install v11.10.1`. That is I need to do that if I'd like to see my Gatsby project running. This is also true if I decide to run gatsby-cli from inside the vs-code terminal...</p>\n      <p>Overall not that big of a deal right? 15ish characters, heck I've used more than that to whine about it right now.</p>\n      <p>But it is annoying and you have to remember to do it every time, if only there were a way to set that per project.</p>\n      <p>Enter the .nvmrc rile! Woo, now I have a simple file that literally just contains number, in my case at the time of this its `11.10.1`. Nothing fancy for sure, and that brings our typing down to `nvm use`. Not a bad change of events, and you don't have to remember what version number to type. Usually I'd be over the moon about that and ready to call it good, but I did notice something while googling around trying to remember just what the .nvmrc file was called.</p>\n      <p>Remember just a minute ago when I said I've moved back to using zsh? As it turns out nvm & zsh seem to be happy little partners. At least that is according to this <a href=\"https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#zsh\">Github doc</a>. For once installing something in my .zshrc and trying to run it didn't have any downsides, everything worked right out of the box as it were.</p>\n      <img\n        src={\"../../Screenshot from 2019-10-24 05-26-46.png\"}\n        alt=\"Example terminal window of zsh auto running nvm use\"\n      />\n      <p>NVM now auto runs `nvm use` when the little snippet in the .zshrc see a .nvmrc file. Whew! All that just to save 15ish characters..</p>\n      <p>Now the fun part, lets try and import our fancy about-css-modules exmaple</p>\n      <p>\n        <User\n          username=\"Jane Dont\"\n          avatar=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/uifaces/faces/twitter/adellecharles/128.jpg\"\n          excerpt=\"I'm not Jane, go away.\"\n        />\n      </p>\n      <p>Welllllll...

I'm sure it'll be blatently obvious what I'm doing wrong in the near future. Maybe day 11? 15? 25? Hopefully sooner rather than later.</p>\n      <p>And yes, yes I did update my theme.</p>\n      <p>On a happy note though, that is all for Gatsbyjs.org tutorial part-two. Moving onto part-three.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n      <h2>Day 9</h2>\n      <p>More of the css componets, today featuring extend css and js.</p>\n      <p>\n        Our first steps are to add a module.css file to the pages directory, why\n        there I have no idea. Feels like a bad idea for, organization but then\n        again maybe thats not the point and the fine folks at gatsby are just\n        trying to get us running.\n      </p>\n      <p>Then as you can imagine, we need to load that css file into a page. We're continuing with the about-css-modules page we started yesterday. After we import it <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-two/#css-modules\">into the page (step 3</a>, we actually console log it so we can get a better idea of how the modules.css name scoping works.</p>\n      <img\n        src={\"../../Screenshot from 2019-10-23 05-41-31.png\"}\n        alt=\"Screen shot of module page import calls\"\n      />\n      <p>Personally ever since I learned that you can pass a string into a console.log statement and still pass the thing you are trying to log, all in one go I've never looked back. For those not terribly familiar with logs, I'm referring to the console.log('styles', styles) part. You'll notice the first styles is inside quotes, that is the string, and the second part is the modules.css object that we've imported on line 4.</p>\n      <img\n        src={\"../../Screenshot from 2019-10-23 05-50-01.png\"}\n        alt=\"console log of styles obect\"\n      />\n      <p>Now if you remember all the way back to yesterdya, day 8, we learned about the component scoping css aspect of the modules.css. Here we get to see some of it in action. Later after we build a new component I'm sure we'll be seeing it rendered to the dom.</p>\n      <p>\n        Neat, now that we see that we can continuing with the css module example and build out a component.\n      </p>\n      <p>The rest will have to wait till tomorrow, as I'm out of time for the day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n      <h2>Day 8</h2>\n      <p>\n        Gatsby Tutorial part-two, css.

According to the tutorial, by using the\n        css as a .module.css Gatsby will render components like this, all\n        bundled up as one little self contained thing. All so we don't have css\n        issues with other components. Thanks Obama.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        This is just a simple example of course, I'm assuming that in the future\n        you can hold components inside other components and so on.

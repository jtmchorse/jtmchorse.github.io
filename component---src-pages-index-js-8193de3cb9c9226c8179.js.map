If someone else had to jump in and was looking down through the code.. WTF why Pacha? Or in all reality you are likely to forget why you did what you did in all of 2 or 3 days, let alone coming back to a project months after you put it down. So, yeah. Lets be lame and call it by what it does. Layout2 it is..</p>\n    </div>\n\n    <div>\n      <h2>Day 10 - Finishing up zsh components and some nvm love</h2>\n      <p>For whatever reason every time I start up a bash, or more recently a zsh terminal I have to run `nvm install v11.10.1`. That is I need to do that if I'd like to see my Gatsby project running. This is also true if I decide to run gatsby-cli from inside the vs-code terminal...</p>\n      <p>Overall not that big of a deal right? 15ish characters, heck I've used more than that to whine about it right now.</p>\n      <p>But it is annoying and you have to remember to do it every time, if only there were a way to set that per project.</p>\n      <p>Enter the .nvmrc rile! Woo, now I have a simple file that literally just contains number, in my case at the time of this its `11.10.1`. Nothing fancy for sure, and that brings our typing down to `nvm use`. Not a bad change of events, and you don't have to remember what version number to type. Usually I'd be over the moon about that and ready to call it good, but I did notice something while googling around trying to remember just what the .nvmrc file was called.</p>\n      <p>Remember just a minute ago when I said I've moved back to using zsh? As it turns out nvm & zsh seem to be happy little partners. At least that is according to this <a href=\"https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#zsh\">Github doc</a>. For once installing something in my .zshrc and trying to run it didn't have any downsides, everything worked right out of the box as it were.</p>\n      <img\n        src={\"../../Screenshot from 2019-10-24 05-26-46.png\"}\n        alt=\"Example terminal window of zsh auto running nvm use\"\n      />\n      <p>NVM now auto runs `nvm use` when the little snippet in the .zshrc see a .nvmrc file. Whew! All that just to save 15ish characters..</p>\n      <p>Now the fun part, lets try and import our fancy about-css-modules exmaple</p>\n      <p>\n        <User\n          username=\"Jane Dont\"\n          avatar=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/uifaces/faces/twitter/adellecharles/128.jpg\"\n          excerpt=\"I'm not Jane, go away.\"\n        />\n      </p>\n      <p>Welllllll...

I'm sure it'll be blatently obvious what I'm doing wrong in the near future. Maybe day 11? 15? 25? Hopefully sooner rather than later.</p>\n      <p>And yes, yes I did update my theme.</p>\n      <p>On a happy note though, that is all for Gatsbyjs.org tutorial part-two. Moving onto part-three.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n      <h2>Day 9</h2>\n      <p>More of the css componets, today featuring extend css and js.</p>\n      <p>\n        Our first steps are to add a module.css file to the pages directory, why\n        there I have no idea. Feels like a bad idea for, organization but then\n        again maybe thats not the point and the fine folks at gatsby are just\n        trying to get us running.\n      </p>\n      <p>Then as you can imagine, we need to load that css file into a page. We're continuing with the about-css-modules page we started yesterday. After we import it <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-two/#css-modules\">into the page (step 3</a>, we actually console log it so we can get a better idea of how the modules.css name scoping works.</p>\n      <img\n        src={\"../../Screenshot from 2019-10-23 05-41-31.png\"}\n        alt=\"Screen shot of module page import calls\"\n      />\n      <p>Personally ever since I learned that you can pass a string into a console.log statement and still pass the thing you are trying to log, all in one go I've never looked back. For those not terribly familiar with logs, I'm referring to the console.log('styles', styles) part. You'll notice the first styles is inside quotes, that is the string, and the second part is the modules.css object that we've imported on line 4.</p>\n      <img\n        src={\"../../Screenshot from 2019-10-23 05-50-01.png\"}\n        alt=\"console log of styles obect\"\n      />\n      <p>Now if you remember all the way back to yesterdya, day 8, we learned about the component scoping css aspect of the modules.css. Here we get to see some of it in action. Later after we build a new component I'm sure we'll be seeing it rendered to the dom.</p>\n      <p>\n        Neat, now that we see that we can continuing with the css module example and build out a component.\n      </p>\n      <p>The rest will have to wait till tomorrow, as I'm out of time for the day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n      <h2>Day 8</h2>\n      <p>\n        Gatsby Tutorial part-two, css. Specifically{\" \"}\n        <a\n          href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-two/#using-component-scoped-css\"\n          target=\"_blank\"\n          rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\n        >\n          #using-component-scoped-css\n        </a>\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        This example takes us through building a micro component, and giving it\n        some css. Not just any css file though, this is a .module.css file\n      </p>\n      <p>Why is that special?</p>\n      <p>Component-scoped CSS</p>\n      <p>\n        As the tutorial page describes, \"CSS Modules are very popular because\n        they let you write CSS normally but with a lot more safety. The tool\n        automatically generates unique class and animation names, so you donâ€™t\n        have to worry about selector name collisions.\"\n      </p>\n      <p>But why is that useful?</p>\n      <p>\n        Lets take a look at our{\" \"}\n        <Link to=\"/about-css-modules/\">container componet</Link> that we created\n        in this section.\n      </p>\n      <img\n        src={\"../../Screenshot from 2019-10-22 05-44-17.png\"}\n        alt=\"Screen shot of css component\"\n      />\n      <p>\n        Nothing super fancy, obviously. But we can still use this to try and\n        learn what we should be here.\n      </p>\n      <img\n        src={\"../../Screenshot from 2019-10-22 06-06-11.png\"}\n        alt=\"Browser rendered view of css component\"\n      />\n      <p>\n        What is super neat here in the inspector is that we have unique\n        classnames for the component. According to the tutorial, by using the\n        css as a .module.css Gatsby will render components like this, all\n        bundled up as one little self contained thing. All so we don't have css\n        issues with other components. Thanks Obama.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        This is just a simple example of course, I'm assuming that in the future\n        you can hold components inside other components and so on.

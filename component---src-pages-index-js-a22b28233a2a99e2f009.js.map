Not just any css file though, this is a .module.css file\n      </p>\n      <p>Why is that special?</p>\n      <p>Component-scoped CSS</p>\n      <p>\n        As the tutorial page describes, \"CSS Modules are very popular because\n        they let you write CSS normally but with a lot more safety. The tool\n        automatically generates unique class and animation names, so you donâ€™t\n        have to worry about selector name collisions.\"\n      </p>\n      <p>But why is that useful?</p>\n      <p>\n        Lets take a look at our{\" \"}\n        <Link to=\"/about-css-modules/\">container componet</Link> that we created\n        in this section.\n      </p>\n      <img\n        src={\"../../Screenshot from 2019-10-22 05-44-17.png\"}\n        alt=\"Screen shot of css component\"\n      />\n      <p>\n        Nothing super fancy, obviously. But we can still use this to try and\n        learn what we should be here.\n      </p>\n      <img\n        src={\"../../Screenshot from 2019-10-22 06-06-11.png\"}\n        alt=\"Browser rendered view of css component\"\n      />\n      <p>\n        What is super neat here in the inspector is that we have unique\n        classnames for the component. According to the tutorial, by using the\n        css as a .module.css Gatsby will render components like this, all\n        bundled up as one little self contained thing. All so we don't have css issues with other\n        components. Thanks Obama.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        This is just a simple example of course, I'm assuming that in the future\n        you can hold components inside other components and so on. Feels like\n        building any sort of not basic site would require that.\n      </p>\n      <p>Unexpected issues from today</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Inserting images</li>\n      </ul>\n\n    </div>\n    <div>\n      <h2>Day 7</h2>\n      <p>package.json</p>\n      <p>\n        Long story short, as best I can tell running the gatsby-cli update\n        installed a newer dependency inside my repo, and there was the mismatch\n        between gatsby-cli and react. Finally I side by side checked both pages\n        in my fancy site vs a fresh install and aside from the gh-deploy script,\n        the only difference I could find was that cli update in the dependencies\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        How to fix it?

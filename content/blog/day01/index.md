### Day 5

 You might be wondering what happened to day 1-4, I'll tell you.
 
 Day 1 - Install gatsby default locally, change some text
 
 Day 2 - Install gh-pages, deploy to github pages, life is good!
 
 Day 3 - Lol wut? Gatsby won't run `develop` anymore
 
 Day 4 - Okay, so turns out running gh-pages builds everything into /root
   and just really mucks things up from a development standpoint, but
   considering the idea is to build a static site I'll work around that for
   now
 
 Day 5 - Move all development into a feature branch, then build in master
   and deploy that to gh-pages.
 

   

    

## Good morning.
Welcome to my new gatsby site. but why? Read more about it on
[about](/about).
      
      
Eventually I'll be doing weekly posts about front end development, but
for now I'm going to have to be happy with a single page.

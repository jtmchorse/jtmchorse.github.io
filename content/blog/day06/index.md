### Day 6

Dependecy hell
      
So I was continuing to work through the tutorials, only to be met with a
little "hey update gatsby-cli" suggestion in my bash shell. And I did.
And given what I described this days overview as, I'm guessing you can
tell what transpired
  
Everything stopped working.
error The above error occurred in the StoreStateProvider component:
in StoreStateProvider in App
  
React will try to recreate this component tree from scratch using the
error boundary you provided, App. error Warning: App: Error boundaries
should implement getDerivedStateFromError(). In that method, return a
state update to display an error message or fallback UI. error UNHANDLED
REJECTION
  
  
Error: Invariant Violation: Invalid hook call. Hooks can only be called
inside of the body of a function component. This could happen for one of
the following reasons: 1. You might have mismatching versions of React
and the renderer (such as React DOM) 2. You might be breaking the Rules
of Hooks 3. You might have more than one copy of React in the same app
See https://fb.me/react-invalid-hook-call for tips about how to debug
and fix this problem.
  
FML, my family is awake now and I need to go focus on that.

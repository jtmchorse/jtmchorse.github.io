### Day 2 of Udemy

So far this class has been mostly lecture and little action on my side. The author did give a decent description of how the metadata gets parsed in pages.

Section 5.10 shows the GraphiQL page, localhost:8000/___graphql and man this page updates fast. What is shown must be a much older version, there is no sidebar on the left for choosing your fields.

Turns out its pronounced graphical.

Glad I'm still continuing with this, we made a whole new query for site metadata and adjusted the layout. Currently not **ground breaking** but this is a 'master class' so I fully expect to get to some cool stuff later. As is I need all the practice I can get with queries.

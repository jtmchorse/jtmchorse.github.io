### Day 4 - Displaying preview of Markdown 

This video is nearly identical to work we covered from Gatsby's internal tutorials. What we did on [day-16](/day16).

However we do know that repitition is key for learning new things, so going over a simple query again insn't the worst thing in the world.

Also the teacher mentions interpolation several times, and I always appreciate seeing that in use. They also talk about fragements, which I don't fully understand. I'm sure they'll come back around again if they are important.

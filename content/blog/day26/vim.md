### Vim

Once, several years ago, I tried to use vim. I really tried. But I got tired of it, and switched back to sublime.

As you can tell from the title of this post, this will be a page where I detail my re introduction to VIM.

Lets get started.

I'm 100% certain I'll need a plugin called Nerd tree, it is like the sidebar setup you see in VScode.

And since there will be other plugins to deal with, lets make sure we have a plugin manager. Pathogen should be fine, I guess? I don't think I'll have strong opinions on package managers. After all, I use Yarn and NPM and 100% don't notice a difference in my day to day.

Or, that doesn't work and just install vim-up from Cassidoo.

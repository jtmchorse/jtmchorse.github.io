### Hello

Signed up for a few courses today during Black Friday - Beginner Javascript from Wes Bos has been on my list since he announced it on Twitter.

I already owned a few courses from Wes, but I might have jumped in the deep end with those, "Advanced React" might not have been the best bet ever as my first course..

I do know _some_ vanilla JS, but I can get much better.

I should point out I'll still be focusing mainly on Gatsby for the near future.

Today we're going through something along these lines -> [vars & lets](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-var-and-let-in-javascript/)

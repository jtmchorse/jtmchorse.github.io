Hence the returns of my query were only ever images.\nThis is what we're seeing now.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/Screenshot%20from%202019-10-31%2005-19-30.png\" alt=\"gatsby config plugin details\"></p>\n<p>Now that we have that out of the way, we get to start messing about\nwith markdown files.</p>\n<p>After we make our first markdown page, aka MD, we'll need to make a new .js page to run a new query. This time we'll need to install a new plugin so Gatsby knows how to parse MD files. This plugin happens to be called <code>gatsby-transformer-remark</code>. </p>\n<p>Then we start building out the query in our GraphiQL page.\n<img src=\"/Screenshot%20from%202019-10-31%2006-07-46.png\" alt=\"gatsby config plugin details\"></p>\n<!-- <img\n  src={\"../../Screenshot from 2019-10-31 06-06-46.png\"}\n  alt=\"gatsby config plugin details\"\n/> -->\n<p>Again like we learned yesterday, we need to access that data in the js file and display it.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/Screenshot%20from%202019-10-31%2006-07-57.png\" alt=\"gatsby config plugin details\"></p>\n<!-- <img\n  src={\"../../Screenshot from 2019-10-31 06-07-57.png\"}\n  alt=\"gatsby config plugin details\"\n/> -->\n<p>This time we've added a sort to the query pages with a more recent date will show up at the top, and then because we don't want our one MD page to get lonely we make anoter one.\nExample <a href=\"/new-index\">page</a></p>\n<p>As best I can tell at this current time these MD pages have not actually been rendered into an actual page that we can navigate to. More research required here..</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Day 16"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/day16/"}}}

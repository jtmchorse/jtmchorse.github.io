After changing the author name, we  added a whole new field and named it 'createdAt'. The field was not available through the ___graphql site until we restarted the dev server.</p>\n<p>Not the most terribly exciting <em>discovery</em> but rather interesting to me. I think this is one of those smaller 'aha!' moments but for the life of me I can't figure out why, at least not yet.</p>\n<p>After adding the new field to our layout.js file, we jumped into adding a new blog.js file which we'll be adding a query to look through newly added markdown files and show them. All in all this so far is everything I had already done while going through the Gatsbyjs.org tutorials. I'm encouraged by the mini aha, and there is still a lot of content to go. Maybe it'll be worth it in the end, maybe it'll just be a review and not the 'master class' that the title promises.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Day 23"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/day23/"}}}

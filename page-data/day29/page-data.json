But for now I know we're creating all those varaibles to use in checking which page we're on, and how many posts to show per page. You can also see the ternary operator on the first line of the createPage function. We check the path, and if its anything other than the first page we use the currentPage variable <em>interpolated</em> as the page number for the url.</p>\n<p>I will say this about the video lessons so far, they don't do the deep dives I was expecting.

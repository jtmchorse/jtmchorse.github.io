Then you'll notice a ternary statement that prints out minutes or minute. </p>\n<p>If you are like me, you likely forget or just don't know what a ternary operator is. You can think of it <em>like</em> an if else statement except it is not implicit, it is truthy.

Looks like one will have to update the image.js file to query the new image, then update the js file you want to include that. Currently that seems unsustainable, I'm likely missing something though.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Day 33"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/day33/"}}}

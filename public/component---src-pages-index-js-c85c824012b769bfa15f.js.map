Feels like a bad idea for, organization but then\n        again maybe thats not the point and the fine folks at gatsby are just\n        trying to get us running.\n      </p>\n      <p>Then as you can imagine, we need to load that css file into a page. We're continuing with the about-css-modules page we started yesterday. After we import it <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-two/#css-modules\">into the page (step 3</a>, we actually console log it so we can get a better idea of how the modules.css name scoping works.</p>\n      <img\n        src={\"../../Screenshot from 2019-10-23 05-41-31.png\"}\n        alt=\"Screen shot of module page import calls\"\n      />\n      <p>Personally ever since I learned that you can pass a string into a console.log statement and still pass the thing you are trying to log, all in one go I've never looked back. For those not terribly familiar with logs, I'm referring to the console.log('styles', styles) part. You'll notice the first styles is inside quotes, that is the string, and the second part is the modules.css object that we've imported on line 4.</p>\n      <img \n      src={\"../../Screenshot from 2019-10-23 05-50-01.png\"}\n      alt=\"console log of styles obect\"\n      />\n      <p>Now if you remember all the way back to yesterdya, day 8, we learned about the component scoping css aspect of the modules.css. Here we get to see some of it in action. Later after we build a new component I'm sure we'll be seeing it rendered to the dom.</p>\n      <p>\n        Neat, now that we see that we can continuing with the css module example and build out a component.\n      </p>\n      <p>The rest will have to wait till tomorrow, as I'm out of time for the day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n      <h2>Day 8</h2>\n      <p>\n        Gatsby Tutorial part-two, css. Specifically{\" \"}\n        <a\n          href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-two/#using-component-scoped-css\"\n          target=\"_blank\"\n          rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\n        >\n          #using-component-scoped-css\n        </a>\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        This example takes us through building a micro component, and giving it\n        some css. Not just any css file though, this is a .module.css file\n      </p>\n      <p>Why is that special?</p>\n      <p>Component-scoped CSS</p>\n      <p>\n        As the tutorial page describes, \"CSS Modules are very popular because\n        they let you write CSS normally but with a lot more safety. The tool\n        automatically generates unique class and animation names, so you donâ€™t\n        have to worry about selector name collisions.\"\n      </p>\n      <p>But why is that useful?</p>\n      <p>\n        Lets take a look at our{\" \"}\n        <Link to=\"/about-css-modules/\">container componet</Link> that we created\n        in this section.\n      </p>\n      <img\n        src={\"../../Screenshot from 2019-10-22 05-44-17.png\"}\n        alt=\"Screen shot of css component\"\n      />\n      <p>\n        Nothing super fancy, obviously. But we can still use this to try and\n        learn what we should be here.\n      </p>\n      <img\n        src={\"../../Screenshot from 2019-10-22 06-06-11.png\"}\n        alt=\"Browser rendered view of css component\"\n      />\n      <p>\n        What is super neat here in the inspector is that we have unique\n        classnames for the component. According to the tutorial, by using the\n        css as a .module.css Gatsby will render components like this, all\n        bundled up as one little self contained thing. All so we don't have css\n        issues with other components. Thanks Obama.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        This is just a simple example of course, I'm assuming that in the future\n        you can hold components inside other components and so on. Feels like\n        building any sort of not basic site would require that.\n      </p>\n      <p>Unexpected issues from today</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Inserting images</li>\n      </ul>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n      <h2>Day 7</h2>\n      <p>package.json</p>\n      <p>\n        Long story short, as best I can tell running the gatsby-cli update\n        installed a newer dependency inside my repo, and there was the mismatch\n        between gatsby-cli and react. Finally I side by side checked both pages\n        in my fancy site vs a fresh install and aside from the gh-deploy script,\n        the only difference I could find was that cli update in the dependencies\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        How to fix it?
